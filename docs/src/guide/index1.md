for building applications, while VuePress is more lightweight and focused on content-centric static sites.

VitePress
VitePress is the little brother of VuePress. It's also created and maintained by our Vue.js team. It's even more lightweight and faster than VuePress. However, as a tradeoff, it's more opinionated and less configurable. For example, it does not support plugins. But VitePress is powerful enough to make your content online if you don't need advanced customizations.

It might not be an appropriate comparison, but you can take VuePress and VitePress as Laravel and Lumen.

Docsify / Docute
Both are great projects and also Vue-powered. Except they are both fully runtime-driven and therefore not SEO-friendly. If you don’t care for SEO and don’t want to mess with installing dependencies, these are still great choices.

Hexo
Hexo has been serving the Vue 2.x docs well. The biggest problem is that its theming system is static and string-based - we want to take advantage of Vue for both the layout and the interactivity. Also, Hexo’s Markdown rendering isn’t the most flexible to configure.

GitBook
We’ve been using GitBook for most of our sub project docs. The primary problem with GitBook is that its development reload performance is intolerable with a large amount of files. The default theme also has a pretty limiting navigation structure, and the theming system is, again, not Vue based. The team behind GitBook is also more focused on turning it into a commercial product rather than an open-source tool.
